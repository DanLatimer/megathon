Hackathon Project: Multiplayer WiFi Android tank game
========

This project was to create a WiFi Android game that would allow multiple players in the same room to play together. The game is a top down Tank Vs Jeep game where you attempt to destroy the enemy before they destroy you.

The work in this repo is just what we did for the Hackathon, we took it off to a private repo after that for further development.
